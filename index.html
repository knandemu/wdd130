            <p><strong>Kitale</strong> is the county headquater of <strong>Trans-Nzoia County</strong>, county number 26 in Kenya. Its a nice place with best weather contions suitable  for agriculture, 
                this makes it suitable for faming activities hence also refered to as the <strong>bread-basket of our nation.</strong> The different varieties of farm produce are sold out to  feed the  whole nation  and enven
